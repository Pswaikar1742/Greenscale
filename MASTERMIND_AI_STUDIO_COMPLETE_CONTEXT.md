## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What is GreenScale?
An intelligent **Scale-to-Zero autoscaler** for AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes. It eliminates the cost of idle GPUs by automatically scaling worker pods from 0 to N based on job queue length, then scaling back to 0 when idle.

### Tech Stack
- **Orchestrator:** Kubernetes (Minikube)
- **Autoscaler:** KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling)
- **Message Broker:** Redis
- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **AI Engine:** Neysa Llama 3.3 70B Instruct API
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Containerization:** Docker

### Architecture Flow
```
Streamlit UI (app.py)
    ↓
Redis Queue (jobs list)
    ↓
KEDA Scaler (watches Redis)
    ↓
Worker Pods (0→5 replicas)
    ↓
Neysa Llama API
    ↓
Results back to UI
```

---

## ✅ COMPLETED WORK (All Phases)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅
- ✅ Kubernetes namespace created: `greenscale-system`
- ✅ Redis deployed with service (`redis-service:6379`)
- ✅ KEDA installed and configured
- ✅ All K8s manifests created and deployed

### Phase 2: Neysa Integration ✅
- ✅ Switched from OpenAI API to Neysa Llama API
- ✅ Created Kubernetes secrets for API credentials
- ✅ Added host aliases for DNS resolution
- ✅ Updated worker deployment with proper environment variables

### Phase 3: Rebuild & Verification ✅
- ✅ Docker image rebuilt and optimized (165MB)
- ✅ Image loaded into Minikube
- ✅ KEDA ScaledObject deployed and active
- ✅ HPA created by KEDA (0-5 replicas range)
- ✅ All commits pushed to GitHub

### Phase 4: Frontend & Testing ✅
- ✅ Streamlit dashboard completed by Ali
- ✅ Fixed deprecated `st.experimental_rerun()` → `st.rerun()`
- ✅ Worker deployment updated to use `:latest` tag
- ✅ End-to-end testing PASSED
- ✅ All code pushed to `main` branch

---

## 🟢 FINAL STATUS - ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

### Infrastructure (P - Prathmesh) ✅
- ✅ Redis: 1/1 Running
- ✅ Worker Deployment: 0/0 (Scale-to-Zero ready)
- ✅ KEDA ScaledObject: Active, monitoring Redis
- ✅ HPA: Configured 0-5 replicas
- ✅ Docker Image: `greenscale-worker:latest` loaded in Minikube
- ✅ Secrets: `neysa-secret` configured

### Frontend (A - Ali) ✅
- ✅ Streamlit UI: Complete with real-time metrics
- ✅ Job Submission: UUID tracking implemented
- ✅ Results Polling: 60-second timeout with spinner
- ✅ Error Handling: Comprehensive exception handling

### Testing Results ✅
- ✅ Manual Redis test: PASSED (`"2 + 2 = 4"`)
- ✅ Streamlit UI test: PASSED (`"The capital of China is Beijing"`)
- ✅ KEDA scaling: Workers scale 0→1→0 correctly
- ✅ Cooldown period: 30 seconds working as expected

```

---

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

### For Google AI Studio Analysis:

1. **Verify All Files**: Check that all YAML manifests are valid
2. **Docker Image**: Confirm Dockerfile is optimized
3. **Worker Logic**: Validate worker.py handles all edge cases
4. **Deployment**: Ensure all env vars and secrets are properly set

### What We Need From You (AI Studio):

1. Are there any errors in the K8s manifests?
2. Is the worker code robust against API failures?
3. Are there any security issues in the configuration?
4. What improvements would you recommend?
5. Is everything ready for production-scale testing?

### What We're Waiting For:

- **Ali (A)**: Complete `src/app.py` with Streamlit UI
  - Must connect to Redis
  - Must push jobs to 'jobs' list
  - Must display results
  - Must show queue status

## 🔄 PROGRESS UPDATE (31 January 2026 - CURRENT SESSION)

### Actions Completed by P (Prathmesh - Platform Engineer):

#### 1. **Code Integration** ✅
   - Pulled latest changes from `main` branch
   - Merged into `infra-backend` branch without conflicts
   - Commit: `24a0978` - "Merge main into infra-backend: resolved conflicts"

#### 2. **Merge Conflict Resolution** ✅
   - **File**: `src/worker.py`
   - **Conflict Points**:
     - Import statements: Added `uuid` import from main
     - Job parsing logic: Kept enhanced parsing with JSON decoding
     - Error handling: Maintained job_id tracking and result saving
     - API payload: Kept improved prompt extraction
   - **Resolution Strategy**: Kept infra-backend improvements + merged main's additions
   - **Result**: File now has best of both branches

#### 3. **Docker Build & Verification** ✅
   - Command: `docker build -t greenscale-worker:latest .`
   - Build Status: **SUCCESS** (38.0s build time)
   - Image Size: **165MB** (optimized)
   - Architecture: **amd64 (Linux)**
   - Dependencies Installed: redis, requests, python-dotenv, pydantic
   - Multiple versions available: v1, v2, latest

#### 4. **Git Status** ✅
   - Current Branch: `infra-backend`
   - Tracking: `origin/infra-backend`
   - Status: All changes committed
   - No uncommitted changes

### Code Quality Improvements from Merged Branches:

**From `main` branch (A's work)**:
- Added `uuid` import (future use for job IDs)
- Improved comments documenting the process

**Preserved from `infra-backend` (P's work)**:
- ✅ JSON parsing of job content: `job_data = json.loads(job_json_string)`
- ✅ Job ID extraction: `job_id = job_data.get("job_id")`
- ✅ Prompt extraction: `prompt = job_data.get("prompt")`
- ✅ Validation logic for job format
- ✅ Result caching with job_id: `redis_client.set(f"result:{job_id}", ...)`
- ✅ Error handling with job_id tracking
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

### Docker Image Analysis:

```
Image: greenscale-worker:latest
ID: b6995a272366
